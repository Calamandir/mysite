<p>So many people think that cats fall under the catagory of good or evil but I propose that mostly they are just odd and for the following reasons.</p>
<ul>
	<li>They will fall over in an attempt to rub on something to communicate with you<br>

	<li>They will attack a moving animal but they will become terrified of simple items like cucumbers and plastic bags.<br>
